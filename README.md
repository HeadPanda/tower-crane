# Tower Crane
A casual game about building a tower, made for Gamedev.js Jam. This is my 2nd attempt at making a game. There is no victory or defeat, you can drop as many blocks as you want, and if you somehow make it to space, you can consider yourself a tower building expert. Recommended to play with sound and a cup of tea.
